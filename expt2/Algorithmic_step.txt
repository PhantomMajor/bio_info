ALGORITHMIC STEPS

1. Include headers and open 1asy.pdb in read mode.
2. Declare necessary variables.
3. Start loop (one line at a time from 2asy.pdb into a string)
	{
		if current line matches "ATOM":
		{
			if char is A:
			{then put in array_protein}

			if char is R:
			{then put in array_rna}
		} end if
	} end loop

4. Start outer loop in RNA array:
	{
		start inner loop in protein array:
		{
			if distance <= 4.5:
			{store in array_interacting}
		} end inner loop
	} end outer loop

5. Print to o/p file (pdb in write mode)
	start loop on array_interacting:
	{
		print in g in find
	} end of loop
END OF PROGRAM

6. Clear all the open files.
